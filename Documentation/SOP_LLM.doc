Coming from a family of lawyers, I always had the opportunity to see and learn how lawyers work and the demands of the profession. 
However, even-though it was a part of our life, I was not so keen on pursuing the legal profession. I was intimidated by the idea of standing before a panel
and presenting a case for others. In retrospection, it could have been a fear of public speaking, though. So, I focused myself on other subjects, and eventually, graduated in 
Computer Science and Engineering.   

After my degree course, I worked for a few years as a software developer. I did well in the job, but never passionate. In my fourth year of 
work, when I was planning a switch, a chance discussion with a friend landed me in a techno legal job, with one of the most prominent companies in the 
engineering world, Siemens. The job as an open source compliance professional involved studying and interpreting open source licenses, legal contracts, and their impact in development, usage, 
and distribution of software. Two years in to the job, I realised that legal documentation, contracts and reading them in the context of technologies was 
something that I enjoyed doing. 

Some early appreciations and awards in my job paved the way for my enjoyment turning to a strong liking towards the subject. I have had opportunities to 
work with many pioneers and lawyers in the intellectual property space during my employment tenure. That had opened doors to exploring more about 
legal side of corporations and the stakes involved. 

After almost a decade of working in the open source license compliance team in Siemens, I recently took the next step in my career when I started 
working for an open source project, as a senior program manager, in the Intellectual Property compliance team. We are a team of four, which include two 
of most prominent lawyers in the intellectual property and open source licensing areas in Europe. I have been working with them for more than an year, and 
there have been many occations when I got commended for my eye for detail, and for comprehension of legal matters. These experiences, along with advice from
people in the field have made me commit to this field, and convinced me that it is time to pursue a legal degree. I was open to a generic legal degree, or a specialization
in Intellectual Property law.

I have been trying to find out the right course for me for some time. I have been researching for a while, and came to a conclusion that, it would be good 
for me to pursue a short term legal related course, rather than a full time LLB. I was already inclined towards not pursuing an LLB due 
to various constraints like lack of many online LLB courses on offer, or lack of accredited universities offering online LLB. So, I decided
that going for a masters degree in law would benefit me more, at this point. In my pursuit, I had conversations with a number of 
universities over the period of the last one and half years. Some of the course had constraints like a pre-requisite of a bachelors degree in law
for LLM courses, or, when an university offered a waiver on that, considering my work experience, the fees was very high. 

This was when I came to know about the GGU LLM offered in partnership with upGrad. I had lengthy conversations with the representative from upGrad regarding 
the University, the acreditation etc., and this was when I came to know about the GGU, and its history with online degrees. I researched a bit deeper in to the 
contents of International Corporate and Financial Law, and understood that it would be a an ideal course to pursue, given that a specialization in Intellectual Property Law
is not on offer now. I believe that the contents of the course could help me, as I can explore more areas of law in addition to the 
Intellectual Property Law, there by enhancing my career chances.
