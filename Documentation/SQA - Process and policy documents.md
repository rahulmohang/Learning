## Introduction
Software Quality Assurance (SQA) is a process that assures that all processes and work items of the project are monitored in frequent intervals, and compared against accepted standards. As of now, the standards would be set internally. In the future, the SQA process would be based on the ISO standard. This is a draft and the first step towards creating a Software Quality Assurance program in OSTC.  

## Scope

### Objective Scope 
This document covers **Eclipse Oniro Project** (herein after 'Project') and any other open source projects to which OSTC contributes. As of now, this document is created in the context of the Project, as it is the only open source project to which OSTC contributes.

### Subjective scope
This document is applicable to all the defined processes in the Project.  

## Pipeline Management - Market view
