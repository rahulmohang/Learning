## 1. Introduction
This is the result of a few discussions and reasearch on the feasibility of a contractual employment in Europe from India. I have considered the current salary, and the pros and cons of a few proposals from me. I thought that documenting the information that I collected may benefit for any discussions on this topic in the future. This study was done not to find solutions for any problem, but to see better practical options considering long term prospects for the project and for me. Some of the results could be different in real situations. 

## 2. Benefit analysis
Some of the pros of moving the employment contract to Europe:

1. Proximity to the team 
2. A feeling of belonging to the team 
3. Stability  
4. Better compensation and yearly hikes (Not meant Huawei Technologies India Pvt. Ltd. is paying less)
5. More uniformity in workplace rules similar to the team

Some of the cons of moving the employment contract to Europe:

1. Compliance and rules
2. Initial documentation
3. Chances of double taxation 

After a few discussions, I understood that the cons depends on the type of contract, and compensation benefits. 

## 3. Type of contract
According to my research, there could be different types of contracts. A few of them are listed below:

### 1. Work permit
This could be a long term goal. If my work is benefitting the project, and if you have plans for my service for at least two more years, it would be mutually benefitial. As we are looking to shift irrespective of the jobs, a job offer with a work permit could be used to process a visa for work. This depends on the company hiring policy though. 

### 2. Hire on contract using recruitment company
This would be the next best. This may give me the opportunity to be a contract employ of Huawei, working directly with you. This may need careful involvement and experience of the external recruitment company. 

### 3. Hire on contract as freelancer
This would be an easy approach as far as compliance and regulation, and tax implications are considered. This may involve me providing invoices for the work done per month, and recieving payments as per the invoice. This may not be a good option though, because of the additional work involved per month.  

## 4. Location
The location of hire is more relevant in case of a two year plan. If we could work out on an offer from Ireland, it would be great as we are currently looking to shift to Ireland. Next best would be off-course from Italy. If there is a long term plan, it would be very good if I can work along with you and may get more involved in the project in different roles as we expand Oniro under OSTC. 

In case of hire on contract as Huawei employ or as a freelance employee, the location could be India, and the offer could be from any office of Huawei in Europe.

## 5. Study of salary
The study of salary has been conducted considering the type of contract to be hiring in Europe for remote work from India. 

### 1. Current salary
The current gross salary before tax, starting April 2022, is 40 Lakhs, or 48280 Euros (Cost to company). In addition, benefit of health insurance of 5 lakhs, or 6035 Euros, covering whole family is there. 

i.e. CTC + Health insurance = 54315 Euros

### 2. Industry standard salary
Based on rule of thump in the Indian IT industry, and considering years of experience and the skill set, the salary could be in the range of 48 Lakhs to 52 Lakhs (57936 Euros to 62764 Euros)(Cost to company), without health insurance. Considering, the additional health insurance to be offsetted for, and that the benefits of employee stock option or similar components are not there, anything in the range of 65000 Euros to 70000 Euros would be a competitive salary to start from, even if we consider the fluctuation in conversion rates.  

Industry standard - 65000 Euros to 70000 Euros 

### 3. My expectation of the salary
The ideal case would be matching the industry standard. However, I think, a contract that gives stability for the next two years would be more important than salary. In case of work from India on a contract from Europe, even if the salary and benefit stays almost same for this year, i.e. around 58500 Euros, inclusive of benefits, it would be sufficient for this year. 

If I extent contract from India, the contracting company have a standard hike of ~4 percentage irrespective of performance. That hike is very low considering inflation. I got a better hike this year just because I voiced my concern, and Huawei management approved an exception. 

So, irrespective of whether the salary is upto industry standards or not, I would request you to provide a contract from there. 

Expectation (considering tax, benefits) - 58500 Euros to 60000 Euros
