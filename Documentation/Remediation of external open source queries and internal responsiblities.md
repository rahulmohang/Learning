## 1. Introduction
It is extremely important for an open source project to have a process in place to handle external queries and suggestions from public on various topics. It is especially critical for the project to address the license compliance related queries in a timely and effective manner. It is also important to assign individuals or teams to be responsible for handling such issues. In OSTC, both the above mentioned requirements,are addressed through a small group called the Open Source Review Board.      

## 2. External Open Source Inquiries
Anyone receiving an Open Source Compliance inquiry from outside the OSTC shall refer to the Open Source Review Board, which shall have overall responsibility for dealing with the inquiry, and – where appropriate – for assigning the handling of all or part of it to the appropriate role(s) within the company. This process will be managed through the [OSS Issue Tracker](https://git.ostc-eu.org/oss-compliance/ask-legal).

In all public documentation concerning OSTC, it should be stated that all external inquires concerning open source licensing should be sent the following email address: foss@huawei.com. Email messages sent to such email address will trigger the creation of an issue on the [OSS Issue Tracker](https://git.ostc-eu.org/oss-compliance/ask-legal), which will be assigned to OSRB members who will handle it.
