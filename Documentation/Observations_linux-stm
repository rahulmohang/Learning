## Scope
This document lists the findings of a review after a clean up job to remove licenses identified by Aliens4Friends. 

## Findings
1. Those files with a dual license still has identified decisions without the original license text. This could be because the Aliens4Friends job might 
have checked the 'Apply decision to all future occurrences of this file' in  Clearing decision scope field. 

2. Here, 'https://192.168.80.251/repo/?mod=view-license&upload=458&item=1985603', even the nomos and monk findings are missing. It could be a problem 
of Fossology. Many files like this. e.g. https://192.168.80.251/repo/?mod=view-license&upload=458&item=2032855. I wonder whether it is because I 
removed the license, GPL-1.0-or-later sometime back?

3. Here, 'https://192.168.80.251/repo/?mod=view-license&upload=458&item=2013605', two licenses to choose from based on where the file is used.
